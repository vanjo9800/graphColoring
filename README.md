# Comparing parallellized metaheuristic algorithms solving the Graph Coloring Problem #

We, Ivan Ivanov and Milen Ferev, are developing a scientific project which solves the Graph Coloring Problem using parallelized metaheuristic algorithms. The algorithms are optimized for the current working system and then benchmarked. Currently, a **Genetic** algorithm and an **Ant Colony Optimization** algorithm are implemented. They are still being optimized to fit our needs.

Also, a **web visualizer** which uses Node.JS is provided. It presents the colored graph to the user.
