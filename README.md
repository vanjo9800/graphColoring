# Comparing parallellized metaheuristic algorithms solving the Graph Coloring Problem #

This is an alternative algorithm of the Ant Colony Optimization to the standard MPI-based one. It is made especially for the Epiphany processor of the Parallella board.

Also, a the **web visualizer** is updated for this implementation fo the algorithm.
